				<p>My name is Ross Cradock and I am currently a student at Blanchardstown Institute of Tecnology studying computer science.
					I have been working with Android for over a year and have been involved with two start-up companies for the latter six months of that year.<br><br>
					I began learning android with Udacity's online course but moved from there to <a href="http://mistcallsapp.com/">MistCalls</a> which is a communication
					and call organising app. With this app the founder has won Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur of the year for Roscommon claiming both the best new idea
					and the best overall categories.<br><br>
					Since relocating I have began work with another company in swords called <a href="http://www.golfbirdie.ie/">GolfBirdie</a>. This company uses drones
					with cameras attached to film flyovers of golf courses which are then availible to be viewed on the app. Currently the app is availible on iOS and should
					be availible on Android sometime in the new year. GolfBirdie have been accepted into the <a href="http://dublintechsummit.com/">Dublin Tech Summit</a>
				 	this year as one of the top 100 start-ups across europe.<br><br>
					I am constantly developing and studying both the Java programing language and the Android platform.</p>
