						<h2><a href ="article.html">Create A Simple Dead-Man Switch</a></h2>
						<p class="develop_article_body">A dead-man switch is a program that requires an periodic input from the user. If it fails to 
						get this input then the switch will trigger. There are some apps on the market but given that this is such an easy app to make and 
						there is a wide variety of possible outcomes to a fail-safe situation then it may be something you need to customise to yourself.</p>

						<h2><a href ="article.html">Porting From iOS</a></h2>
						<p class="develop_article_body">Most apps these days are written in iOS first then ported to Android. The reason being that the owners of an apple
						device will pay more for in-app purchases or for apps and it is easier to develop for one version, from one manufacturer with one set of standards.
						But no app will be transformed into Android exactly like the it's apple counterpart.</p>

						<h2><a href ="article.html">Responding In The Notification</a></h2>
						<p class="develop_article_body">One of Google's goals over the last number of years is to increase the user's ability to change from one app to another 
						with ease. This is clear from I/O 16 where multitasking is coming with android version 7 and the ability to respond to messages in the notification drop
						down screen. Facebook's messager have always had the ability to overlay any other app so responses are made quickly. Perhaps with Google's new chat service
						Allo they are more inclined to take the edge away from messager. But what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Here is how to make the most out
						of the new improved notification.</p>
